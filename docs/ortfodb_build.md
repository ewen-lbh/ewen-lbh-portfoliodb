## ortfodb build

Build the database

### Synopsis

Scan in the projects directory for folders with description.md files (and potential media files) and compile the whole database into a JSON file at <to-filepath>.

If <to-filepath> is "-", the output will be written to stdout.

If [include-works] is provided, only works that match the pattern will be included in the database.


```
ortfodb build <to-filepath> [include-works] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -e, --exporters stringArray   Exporters to enable. If not provided, all the exporters configured in the configuration file will be enabled.
  -h, --help                    help for build
  -m, --minified                Output a minifed JSON file
      --no-cache                Disable usage of previous database build as cache for this build (used for media analysis among other things).
  -q, --silent                  Do not write to stdout
      --workers int             Use <count> workers to build the database. Defaults to the number of CPU cores. (default 12)
      --write-progress string   Write progress information to a file. See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ortfo/db#ProgressInfoEvent for more information.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string   config file path (default "ortfodb.yaml")
      --scattered       Operate in scattered mode. In scattered mode, the description.md files are searched inside `.ortfo' folders in every folder of the database directory, instead of directly in the database directory's folders. See https://github.com/ortfo/
```
