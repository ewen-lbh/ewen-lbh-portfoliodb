## ortfodb replicate

Replicate a database directory from a built database file.

### Synopsis

Replicate a database from <from-filepath> to <to-filepath>. Note that <to-filepath> must be an empty directory.

Example: ortfodb replicate ./database.json ./replicated-database/

WARNING: This command is still kind-of a WIP, it works but there's minimal logging and error handling.


```
ortfodb replicate <from-filepath> <to-filepath> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help        help for replicate
  -n, --no-verify   Don't try to validate the built database file before replicating
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string   config file path (default "ortfodb.yaml")
      --scattered       Operate in scattered mode. In scattered mode, the description.md files are searched inside `.ortfo' folders in every folder of the database directory, instead of directly in the database directory's folders. See https://github.com/ortfo/
```
